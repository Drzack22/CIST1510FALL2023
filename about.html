			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>Oooga-Booga camp is a non-profit organization that is run by an 
			   passionate group of friends that came together to make their vision a reality. 
               What was their vision you may ask? To provide a place for the rising generation of the 21st
			   century to experience the wonders of nature. Coryxkenshin, our founder, had these words to say 
			   about the creation of Oooga-Booga Camp.</p>
			<blockquote>&ldquo;<b>Well it's quite a funny story actually. You see, me and my best friend, or as you guys
               know him co-founder Dashie, were talking about the horror games that were coming out around this time.
               We had just finished a roblox horror game and were talking about the how it improved when it just hit me.
               'what if we start a camp for the kids with a horror like name?'. It was history from there! </b>&rdquo;</blockquote>
