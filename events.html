				<figcaption>What is a camp without camping? Here at Camp Oooga-Booga we 
				offer two types of camping options. You can go on the main sight for
                more laid back camping of our camping grounds or drive to our park Where
				it is just the woods and you (don't worry there won't be any bears in this 
				area).

				<figcaption>Yes. You read that right. After repeated test runs and experiment with the river, along with getting
				approval from government agencies like "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service", we have been approved to host
				expeditions down the river. The total length of the river reaches 235 miles, while the trail we will be you
			    will be canoeing down is 140 miles. I know. Quite the Distance! Do not worry though, as there will be multiple 
				places to get off the river along the trail. The age requirement for 
				this is 18 or older. No kids on this trip to reduce the risk of anything happening.
